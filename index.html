                    <h2>Resturant and Managament Experience</h2>
                    <p>I worked in resturants for 10 years. Half of that time I managed in a variety of positions. From
                        lead-line, Sous chef, kitchen manager and Pastry lead. During this time I learend how to work
                        coherently with team members. I feel this is a very valiable skill in almost every profession,
                        but especially in programming. </p>

                    <h2>My-Education</h2>
                    <p> I went to De La Salle North Catholic and Benson Polytechnic highscool. At De La Salle I took
                        classes focused on enterpernuism and advanced physics. At Benson I took classes in auto
                        mechanics and programming. I gradurated a year early with high honors and a major in
                        Auto-Mechanics. I attended Mt. Hood Community College for 1 year. During that calss I took
                        programming classes on python and classes on basic computer communications. </p>

                    <p>I was born adn raised in Portland Oregon. With an extreme passion for cooking I persued a
                        culinary career for 10 years. I decided to change gears to programming for a better work life
                        balance. In my off time I am often gardening, hiking, foraging, practicinig archery, or hanging
                        out with friends. </p>
